Yes, you can optimize this code segment to handle any number of servers by redesigning how communication channels are used. In PROMELA (the modeling language used with the Spin model checker), you cannot use variable indices directly in channel operations (like send and receive). This limitation makes it challenging to generalize code that relies on indexing channels dynamically.

To overcome this, you can use a single channel for all `RequestVote` messages and include sender (`from`) and receiver (`to`) identifiers within the message itself. This approach allows you to generalize the code for any number of servers (`n`) without hardcoding each `RequestVoteChannel`.

Here's how you can modify your code:

1. **Define a single channel with message fields for `from` and `to`:**

   ```promela
   #define N  // Number of servers

   typedef RequestVoteMessage {
       byte term;
       byte lastLogIndex;
       byte lastLogTerm;
   }

   chan requestVoteChannel = [N * N] of { byte from; byte to; RequestVoteMessage reqVote };
   ```

2. **Modify the server process to receive messages intended for it:**

   ```promela
   do
   :: requestVoteChannel ? from, to, requestVote when to == serverId ->
       assert(from != serverId);
       // Process the RequestVote message from 'from' server
       // Update terms, logs, etc.
       // Send a response back to the sender if necessary
   od
   ```

3. **When sending a `RequestVote` message, include the `from` and `to` fields:**

   ```promela
   for (i : 0 .. N-1) {
       if
       :: i != serverId ->
           requestVoteChannel ! serverId, i, requestVote;
       :: else -> skip;
       fi;
   }
   ```

By doing this, you ensure that each server can handle incoming messages from any other server without hardcoding the channels for each possible sender. The `when to == serverId` guard ensures that a server only processes messages intended for it.

**For the log management part**, your approach using a loop to find the last log term and index works well and can be generalized for any number of logs:

```promela
i = 0;
do
:: (i < MAX_LOG) ->
   if
   :: (logs[serverId].log[i] == 0) ->
       if
       :: (i == 0) -> lastLogTerm = 0;
       :: else -> lastLogTerm = logs[serverId].log[i - 1];
       fi;
       lastLogIndex = i;
       break;
   :: (i == MAX_LOG - 1) ->
       lastLogTerm = logs[serverId].log[i];
       lastLogIndex = i + 1;
       break;
   fi;
   i = i + 1;
:: else -> break;
od;
```

This loop iterates over the logs to find the last non-zero term and its index, making it general for any `MAX_LOG` size.

**In summary**, by changing your communication model to use a single channel with message metadata, you can optimize your code segment to handle any number of servers (`n`). This approach not only makes your code scalable but also simplifies the message handling logic.

Here's the optimized code segment:

```promela
#define N  // Total number of servers

typedef RequestVoteMessage {
    byte term;
    byte lastLogIndex;
    byte lastLogTerm;
}

chan requestVoteChannel = [N * N] of { byte from; byte to; RequestVoteMessage reqVote };

proctype Server(byte serverId) {
    RequestVoteMessage requestVote;
    byte from;
    byte to;
    byte i;
    byte lastLogTerm;
    byte lastLogIndex;
    bool logOk;
    bool voteGranted;

    do
    :: requestVoteChannel ? from, to, requestVote when to == serverId ->
        assert(from != serverId);

        // Update terms and other state variables...
        // Compute lastLogTerm and lastLogIndex as per your existing code
        // Determine if the log is up-to-date
        // Decide whether to grant the vote
        // Send a response back to the requesting server
        requestVoteResponseChannel ! serverId, from, voteGranted;
    od
}
```

This way, your code is optimized for any `n` servers, and you avoid the limitations of variable indices in channel operations in PROMELA.
